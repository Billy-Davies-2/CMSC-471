# CMSC-471 : Project 3

This is my image classification code.

Usage:
  `python davies4Proj3.py <Image-File>.jpg`

Which will return:
  ```
  Smile
  Hat
  Dollar
  Hash
  Heart
  ```

Coded entirey in python

**REQUIREMENTS**
Python 3
Training set of images to be placed in the `../Training/` directory relative to this project file.
For the training set, I used the first 50 images in the Training directory for Smile, the next 50 for Hat, and then the next 50 for Hash, and then then next 50 for Heart and then the last 50 for Dollar.
**WARNING:** If you don't do it this way, you will get an improperly trained set and it will greatly impact your overall accuracy.
