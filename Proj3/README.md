# CMSC-471 : Project 3

This is my image classification code.

Usage:
  `python davies4Proj3.py <Image-File>.png`

Which will return:
  ```
  Smile
  Hat
  Dollar
  Hash
  Heart
  ```

Coded entirey in python

**Note:** For best results, I recommend .png image files, but it should work for other image types.
